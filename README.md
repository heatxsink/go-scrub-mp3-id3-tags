go-scrub-mp3-id3-tags
=====================

A quick hack to scrub out camelot wheel keys and energy from mp3 title tag. In order for this to work I had to first convert all of my mp3 tags to id3v2.3 as it seem that iTunes or some of my music was already in v2.4 and the library I'm depending on only supports v2.3. Anyways this isn't meant to be anything too great. Just a way I found to easily fix my mistake of not configuring Mixed in Key properly. :-P The code is meant to be a quick hack and nothing more than that. My apologies in advance if it's not up to your standard.
